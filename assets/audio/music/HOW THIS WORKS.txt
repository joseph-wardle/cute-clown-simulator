TEMPOS (BPM):
lv1 - 108
lv2 - 126
lv3 - 141
lv4 - 161
finale - 189

when the gameplay begins, play [lv1-intro.wav] once
then immediately seamlessly after, put [lv1-loop.wav] on loop

when score is high enough, immediately stop the current loop then play the next intro
like, it should be a sudden cut to the next intro (played once), then just like before, play the corresponding loop seamlessly after

i think that the tempo changes should happen once the [...loop.wav] file starts and let the [...intro.wav] act as a short break cause idk how awkward it would be to program the tempo change to line up

for the finale, same idea
after you've gone through all levels and then reach maximum score, just cut directly to [mus_finale.wav] (no loop, plays only once), and then after the song finishes you win
